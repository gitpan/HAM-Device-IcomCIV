HAM-Device-IcomCIV version 0.02
===============================

This module is an OO approach to use Icom radios attached to a serial port.

HAM::Device::IcomCIV is not an abstract class, but one you can use directly.
It allows for the most basic form of remote control of practically any Icom
radio equipped with a CI-V port, namely set & get of the displayed frequency,
set & get the mode and filter, read the band edges, switch to VFO or Memory
(if radio has a VFO), select a memory channel, write VFO data to memory and
clear a memory.

It supports multiple radios on the same serial port, differentiated by their
CI-V adress. Note: If you have two or more identical models on the same bus,
they must use different CI-V adresses.

This class can be used in a procedural manner or with an event callback
mechanism (or both at the same time). When used without callbacks you just
use the provided methods for setting or getting radio settings (Frequency,
Mode etc.). If you use the callback mechanism you will receive a callback to
your sub (set with set_callback) which tells you what happened, i.e. which
data was received (see event and status constants).
